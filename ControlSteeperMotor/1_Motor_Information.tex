\chapter{Introduction}
In this document, I will attemp to explain all the effects involved in the control
of a stepper motor and how to build a custom driver with the design of a custom PCB.
The objective is to create the main component for providing feedback to a Steering Wheel.
This Documents it's somewhat like a guide on how to create a driver(PCB), covering:
\begin{itemize}
\item Effects involved in stepper motor
\item Stepper motor characteristics
\item Electronics components for motor control
\item Market solutions analysis for PCB design
\item PCB design Guidelines for stepper motor control
\item Selection of electronics components
\item Simulation with Ngspice
\end{itemize}
All of this topics will be illustrated with a real-world example.\\
\textbf{Note:} this is the first version of this document, so there may be 
some errors for which i am not responsible

\chapter{Effects involved in stepper motor}
\section{What Is a Stepper Motor?}
A stepper motor is an electrical motor, and like any electric motor they have coils, the main 
difference with others motors it's his construction, with his construction it have some interesting
capabilities, like rotate in discrete \textbf{steps}, rotating in fixed angles such 0.8\degree or 
1.9\degree, althought the exact step size depends in themanufacture.\\
To move(rotate) a stepper motor, a special driver is necessary that provides the correct current, voltage and
the order to energize the coils.
