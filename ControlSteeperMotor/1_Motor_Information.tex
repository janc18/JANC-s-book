\chapter{Introduction}
In this document, I will attemp to explain all the effects involved in the control
of a stepper motor and how to build a custom driver with the design of a custom PCB.
The objective is to create the main component for providing feedback to a Steering Wheel.
This Documents it's somewhat like a guide on how to create a driver(PCB), covering:
\begin{itemize}
\item Effects involved in stepper motor
\item Stepper motor characteristics
\item Electronics components for motor control
\item Market solutions analysis for PCB design
\item PCB design Guidelines for stepper motor control
\item Selection of electronics components
\item Simulation with Ngspice
\end{itemize}
All of this topics will be illustrated with a real-world example.\\
\textbf{Mote:} this is the first version of this document, so there may be 
some errors for which i am not responsible
